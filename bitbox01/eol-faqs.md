# BitBox01 end-of-sale/life FAQs

As of 12 November 2019, the BitBox01 is no longer available for purchase. If you are a BitBox01 owner, please look through the FAQs below. If you have a question that you don’t find answered below, then please {% include 'contact-no-email.html' %}


### Why is BitBox01 no longer being sold?

The BitBox01 started development in 2014 and was released in 2016. Four years later, the industry has matured and changed significantly. When it comes to security, we believe users are best served with the most up-to-date products. The BitBox01 is superseded by the BitBox02. 

For more information, please read our [blog post](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/announcing-the-bitbox01-aka-digital-bitbox-end-of-sale-and-end-of-life-dates-and-process-1da088f74e32).


### Can I continue to use my BitBox01?

Yes. We will continue to support the BitBox01 with security updates and bug fixes until November 2020 after which we cannot guarantee continued updates. After November 2020, the BitBox01 will still be usable but may have limited functionality. For example, it may no longer be supported natively in the app. To avoid unnecessary hassle after the end of support date, we recommend moving over to a BitBox02 before November 2020. 

Follow our guide to migrate funds from BitBox01 to BitBox02](https://guides.shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox01/other/sweep-to-bitbox02/).

To export your private key from the BitBox01 microSD card backup directly, please use our [backup center tool](https://guides.shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox01/other/backup-center/).


### Will my coins still be safe?

Yes. Your coins will still be stored on the BitBox01. The BitBox01 will continue to work. You will always be able to recover and transfer your funds regardless of the end of support date. However, after November 2020, it may be less convenient to move funds off the BitBox01 due to limited functionality. We recommend moving your funds to a BitBox02 or another wallet before then.

### What does EOL (end-of-life) mean?

EOL (end-of-life) for the BitBox01 means that we will stop actively releasing updates for the BitBox01 after November 2020, but may continue to do so if circumstances allow. EOL also means that the lifetime warranty terminates after this date.


### I’m a BitBox01 owner, do I get a discount on a BitBox02?

Yes. We’re offering all BitBox01 customers a 30% loyalty discount to move over to the BitBox02. The discount code will be available as an in-app notification included in the BitBoxApp (version 14.15.0).


### I’m still confused, can I talk to someone?

If you have any questions, please  {% include contact-small.html %}
We will still offer customer support to BitBox01 users after November 2020.
