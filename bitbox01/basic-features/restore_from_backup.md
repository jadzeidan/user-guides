In order to reset from a backup, your BitBox01 needs to be reset.

## Plug in the microSD card with your backup and plug in the BitBox01
In order to be able to restore from a backup file, the microSD card with the backup on it needs to be inserted into the BitBox01. Once done, plug in your BitBox01.


## Choose that you want to restore from a backup file
Please select that you want to restore from a backup file on your microSD card by clicking "Restore a wallet from a backup".

## Start the restoring process
The BitBox App will now remind you that your microSD card with your backup file needs to be inserted into the BitBox01 and that you will need recovery password.

Click "Continue"

Next input the recovery password for that wallet.

**Attention:** There will be no error if you input a different recovery password than the one you used when you created your wallet. The BitBox01 does not store information about your recovery password and therefore can't "check" if it is the same one you used before or not.
If you cannot find your funds after you restored you have most likely inputed a different recovery password. In that case, please restore from your backup again and make sure that you input the same recovery password you used when you created your wallet.

Check the box and click "Restore".

## Done! Start using your BitBox01
You have successfully restored your wallet and can continue using your BitBox01 as usual.

>Please make sure you store your backup microSD card in a secure location and that you don't lose your recovery password.
**Reminder:** Only the backup microSD + recovery password allows you to restore your wallet. One of the two is not enough.
