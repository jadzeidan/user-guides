[Click here to see how to check if you have a valid backup.]({%link bitbox01/basics/managing-backups.md %}#verifying-a-backup) Once enabled, the microSD slot, necessary for backups, and mobile app pairing is disabled. These are re-enabled only after resetting your BitBox01. To then restore your wallet you will need the **microSD card backup and your recovery password!**
