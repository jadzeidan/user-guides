In order to reset from a backup, your BitBox02 needs to be reset.

## Plug in the microSD card containing your backup and plug in the BitBox02
In order to be able to restore from a backup, the microSD card containing the backup needs to be inserted. Once done, plug in your BitBox02 with the BitBoxApp open.

As your device is reset, you will first need to pair it again.

Please compare the code on your BitBox02 and in the BitBoxApp and confirm on your BitBox02 if they match. Then click "Confirm & Continue" in the BitBoxApp.

## Choose backup file
The BitBoxApp will now remind you that your microSD card with your backup needs to be inserted if not already done.

Next you will see a list of all backup files that were found on your microSD card.

In most cases that would just be one file.

Select the wallet you want to restore and click "Restore".
