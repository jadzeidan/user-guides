{% if include.product == "BitBox02" %}
## Verify receive address

You will then see the first few characters of a receive address. In order to get the complete address you need to verify it on your {{include.product}} by clicking "Show and verify full address on device".

![alt text]({% link assets/images/BitBox02_receive/receive2.png %})

The address will then be shown on your {{include.product}} and the BitBoxApp at the same time.
{% endif %}

## Copy or scan address
You can then scan the QR-code or copy the address.

{% if include.product == "BitBox02" %}
Please confirm that the address you scanned with your other wallet and the address shown on your BitBox02 match.

 **Rule:** Always trust your hardware wallet, not the wallet app.

## Receive
You can now use this address to send coins to your {{include.product}}. When you want to make another transaction to your {{include.product}} create a new receive address first, don't re-use addresses.
