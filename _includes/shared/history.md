## Transaction types
There are four different types of transactions that can show up in your transaction history.

### Pending incoming transaction
An incoming transaction will at first be pending. That means it is not confirmed in the Bitcoin blockchain yet. You can see that the transaction in the screenshot is pending in two spots.

1. It says "Pending" on the "STATUS" column.
2. Below the wallet balance it says "Incoming +0.00093551 BTC"

### Confirmed incoming transaction
Once a formerly pending transaction has its first confirmation (i.e. it was included in a block) it is shown as a confirmed transaction and the transaction amount is added to your wallet balance.

## Transaction details
If you want to see further details about a transaction you can click on the "details symbol" on the left of each row.

Clicking that will open a pop-up and show you additional transaction details.
